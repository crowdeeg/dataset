# CrowdEEG Dataset with Expert Adjudication Discussions

This repository contains a dataset for a medical time series classification task acquired using **[CrowdEEG](https://crowdeeg.ca/)**. Beyond classification labels, the dataset includes structured arguments from adjudication discussions of 3 medical experts per contentious classification decision.

The corpus has been referenced in the following papers:

* Mike Schaekermann, Graeme Beaton, Elaheh Sanoubari, Andrew Lim, Kate Larson, and Edith Law: **[Ambiguity-aware AI Assistants for Medical Data Analysis](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376506)**. [CHI 2020](http://chi2020.acm.org/).

This repository only contains classification labels and adjudication arguments, not the raw medical time series records. Please reach out to Mike Schaekermann (mikeschaekermann@gmail.com) to request access to the underlying raw time series data.
